- Later simplified to just "TBA" for better visual fit
- Removed prices entirely from individual components (not sold separately)

#### 2. Menu Reorganization
- **Before**: Individual items first → Plate combos
- **After**: Plate combos first (featured with orange styling) → "What's On Your Plate" (component descriptions)
- Logic: Show what customers can actually order first, then explain components

- Added quotes around "truck" in title and footer
- Reflects reality: food truck in spirit, home kitchen in practice

- **Expanded chicken description**: Detailed marinade ingredients and 24-hour process
- **Enhanced mac salad description**: Specific technique (hot pasta + vinegar first) and quality ingredients

## Business Plan & Strategy

### Updated Business Model (January 2025)

#### Operating Schedule
- **Weekend-only operation** - Both work full-time jobs during the week
- **Weekly cycle**: 
  - Saturday/Sunday: Orders open
  - Wednesday/Thursday: Order cutoff
  - Saturday/Sunday: Prep, cook, and customer pickup
- **Capacity**: 30-40 plates per week with two-person team
- **Pickup**: Sunday only, customers come to house

#### Revised Menu & Pricing
- **Full Aloha Plate** - $12 (full chicken thigh + 3/4 cup each of mac salad & coconut rice)
- **Mini Aloha Plate** - $8 (half portions of all three items)

#### Cost Analysis (Updated)
**Per Full Aloha Plate:**
- Chicken thigh + marinade (soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, chili flake, garlic, ginger, sesame oil): ~$1.55
- Mac salad (3/4 cup): ~$1.25  
- Coconut rice (3/4 cup): ~$1.00
- **Total food cost: ~$3.80 (32% food cost - excellent margin)**

#### Pickup Operations Plan
- **Time slots**: 2-hour windows (12-2pm, 2-4pm, 4-6pm) 
- **Location**: Customer pickup at house (driveway/front door)
- **Payment**: Venmo or cash
- **Customer experience**: Knock and serve, smell of grilling creates natural marketing

#### Food Prep Strategy
- **Mac salad**: Made ahead in large batch (better flavor when it sits)
- **Coconut rice**: Keep warm in rice cooker until pickup
- **Chicken**: Batch & sear method for optimal efficiency and freshness
  - Pre-cook all marinated chicken thighs fully (7-8 minutes)
  - Keep warm in slow cooker or low oven
  - When customer arrives: 1-2 minute hot sear for fresh char and aroma
  - **Result**: Fresh grill smell and appearance with 2-3 minute per-order timing

#### Market Positioning
- **Target market**: Crozet neighborhood (limited competition, unique offering)
- **Launch strategy**: Soft launch with neighborhood only (~30 initial interested customers)
- **Growth plan**: Start local, possibly expand to farmers market pop-ups
- **Revenue goal**: Fun side income, not primary business

#### Competitive Analysis
- Few food trucks in Crozet specifically
- Many in Charlottesville but none doing authentic Hawaiian
- Unique position as only Hawaiian option in immediate area

#### Key Success Factors
1. **Neighborhood word-of-mouth** from quality and convenience
2. **Authentic recipes** from extensive Hawaii "research" trips
3. **Fresh preparation** - customers see/smell food being made
4. **Manageable scale** - sustainable with full-time jobs
5. **Home advantage** - lower overhead, personal touch

### Original Business Model
- **Home-based operation** (not mobile truck)  
- **Order-ahead service** via email/phone
- **Focus on quality** over quantity
- **Authentic preparation** using traditional techniques

## Future Considerations

### Potential Menu Additions
- Additional protein options (pork, fish)
- More dessert varieties
- Beverage options
- Seasonal specials

### Scaling Options
- Increase order capacity
- Add delivery service
- Expand to actual food truck later
- Catering for events

### Marketing Strategies
- Social media presence showcasing food prep
- Local community events
- Word-of-mouth through quality
- Hawaiian cultural events/festivals

*"We call ourselves a food truck but don't actually have a truck. What we DO have is a kitchen, a dream, and an unhealthy obsession with recreating that perfect plate lunch experience you can only get in Hawaii."*
